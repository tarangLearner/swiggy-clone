# Notes

1. useState - it provides a state variable and method with the help of state variable updates, whenever state variable updates react rerender the list.
2. Reconciliation Algo aka react fiber
   - virtual DOM => its representation of DOM but not actual DOM. its collection of react element and react element is collection of object.
   - Diff algo => its difference between old vs new virtual DOM and reacts render diff between these two virtual DOM
3. ## monolith vs microservice
4. useEffect - it executes after the body renderes on UI. it mainly follows the concept - load -> render -> API call -> re-render. it comes with callback function and that callback function executes once first cycle of render completes.
